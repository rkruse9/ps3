This leads to an explosion of rules and a large number of possible parses for any one sentence. To remove ambiguity between the different parses, it's desirable to move to probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG). In this part of the assignment, you will construct a PCFG from training data, parse using a probabilistic version of CKY, and evaluate the quality of the resulting parses against gold trees.\n",

        "We want the PCFG to be in CNF format because the probabilistic version of CKY that you'll implement next also requires the grammar to be in CNF. However, the gold trees are not in CNF form, so in this case you will need to convert the gold *trees* to CNF before building the PCFG from them. To accomplish this, you should use the `treetransforms` package from `nltk`, which includes functions for converting to and from CNF. In particular, you'll want to make use of `treetransforms.collapse_unary` followed by `treetransforms.chomsky_normal_form` to convert a tree to its binarized version. You can then get the counts for all of the productions used in the trees, and then normalize them to probabilities so that the probabilities of all rules with the same left-hand side sum to 1.\n",

        "I found this segment pretty satisfying to do overall â€“ however there are some issues Iâ€™d like to bring up. One would be the use of Google Colab. For the future, if thereâ€™s a way to make it easier for Windows users in general to do the labs, that would be much better. I know you could do a virtual environment and junipyr notebook, but itâ€™s very complicated (at least for someone with my experience) to do that. Specifically in this problem, every time the runtime restarted it would delete my grammar and replace it. Luckily the first time I save it elsewhere on my device, but it was still a pain to keep copying that over. Furthermore, I felt that somethings like the use of nltk.grammar.ProbabilisticProduction() came out of nowhere (my bad if it was covered in the optional Friday section). I also wish there were more gold examples to check my code against, specifically for problems 4 and 5, as those can be particularly hard to debug. Overall though, best lab of the three so far."

The best method is to \"restart kernel and run all cells\", allowing time for all cells to be run to completion. You should submit your code to Gradescope at the code submission assignment at <http://go.cs187.info/project3-submit-code>. Make sure that you are also submitting your `data/grammar` file as part of your solution code as well.\n",

If that doesn't work, the method that seems to be most reliable is to export the notebook as HTML (if you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can do so using `File -> Print Preview`), open the HTML in a browser, and print it to a file. Then make sure to add the file to your git commit. Please name the file the same name as this notebook, but with a `.pdf` extension. (Conveniently, the methods just described will use that name by default.) You can then perform a git commit and push and submit the commit to Gradescope at <http://go.cs187.info/project3-submit-pdf>."
